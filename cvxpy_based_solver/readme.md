This folder provides experiments about SCvx on stlpy benchmarks.

"experiments" folder provides the running scripts. remember K=T+1, T is time horizon.

"heatmap" folder provides the results and scripts for plotting heatmap of different parameters.

"solution" folder provides the different solution trajectory with given parameter setting.

"time_test_result" shows the running time with different time horizon.

"Discretization" folder is copy from https://github.com/EmbersArc/SCvx and used for system dynamic discretization.

"SCproblem" folder is changed based on https://github.com/EmbersArc/SCvx and used for transforming problem into cvxpy form.

"Models" folder provide different problems with STL formulas.
